 
what is a class in javascript

In JavaScript, a class is a blueprint for creating objects with shared properties and methods. It provides a way to define and create objects with similar characteristics. Classes were introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) to make it easier to work with object-oriented programming concepts in JavaScript.

Here's a basic example of a class in JavaScript:
class Animal {
  constructor(name, sound) {
    this.name = name;
    this.sound = sound;
  }

  makeSound() {
    console.log(`${this.name} says ${this.sound}`);
  }
}

// Creating instances of the Animal class
const dog = new Animal('Dog', 'Woof');
const cat = new Animal('Cat', 'Meow');

// Using the methods of the instances
dog.makeSound(); // Output: Dog says Woof
cat.makeSound(); // Output: Cat says Meow

In this example, Animal is a class with a constructor method that initializes the name and sound properties of an animal. The class also has a makeSound method, which is shared among all instances of the class.

You can create new objects (instances) based on a class using the new keyword, as demonstrated with the dog and cat instances.

It's important to note that prior to ES6, JavaScript used a prototype-based inheritance model, and classes were introduced as a syntactical sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance to make it more familiar and convenient for developers coming from other object-oriented languages. Under the hood, JavaScript's class system is still based on prototypes.
